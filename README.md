# flappy-bird
A python remake of Flappy Bird (rip), all graphics done with pygame, make in 2 hours for fun :)

## Project
I made this Flappy Bird clone for fun to improve my skills with pygame. The code is incredibly tricky to read - I don't advise looking at it atall lmao. I wrote it in around two hours, with only one visit to StackOverflow.
